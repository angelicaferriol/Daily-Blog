    "# Daily Blog #25 – Mental Model: Second-Order Thinking\n",

    "Most people stop at first-order thinking. That means they ask:\n",
    "**\"What happens if I do this?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "But second-order thinkers ask:\n",
    "**\"And then what?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "First-order thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “If I eat this donut, I’ll feel good.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Second-order thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “If I eat this donut, I’ll feel good *now*, but I’ll crash later, gain weight if I do this often, and mess with my long-term energy and focus.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every complex decision has downstream effects. First-order thinkers chase short-term wins and convenience. Second-order thinkers build leverage and avoid traps — *they think in systems, not events*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Apply It Now**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick one decision you're facing today — academic, health, or social. Ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the immediate consequence?\n",
    "2. What are the likely consequences 1 week/month/year from now?\n",
    "3. What if *everyone* did what I’m about to do?\n",
    "4. What system am I reinforcing by doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll notice your standards rise and your bullshit tolerance drops. You stop thinking like a consumer. You start thinking like a strategist."
