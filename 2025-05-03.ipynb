    "##### Why This Entry Matters  \n",
    "Despite barely getting any sleep, I found myself surprisingly engaged in an 8 AM class today. While we were going through some examples, I wasn’t exactly following along with the professors solution. Instead, I was coming up with my own calculation using Bayes' Theorem. When the professor asked for answers, I shared mine in the chatbox. Funny enough, we didn’t use the same formula—and God forbid, I was horrified. But it turns out the professor’s formula was actually incorrect because the derived answer wasn’t even logically possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "So yeah... I somehow got it right. But it still feels kind of embarrassing to be the one clearly not following along, not because I’m trying to act like a know-it-all, I just genuinely enjoy figuring things out on my own.\n",

    "##### Thought-Provoking Find of the Day  \n",
    "[Why Girls May Be Better at Learning Programming](https://massivesci.com/articles/programming-math-language-python-women-in-science/) - This blog somehow concluded that girls should do well in learning programming because they have better language abilities than boys. According to their study, language aptitude explained almost 20% of the difference in how quickly people learned Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s an interesting take, especially since I’ve always associated programming more with mathematics, given its theoretical computational nature. But at the same time, it’s also logical to hypothesize this kind of connection, since Python is literally called a language. Learning a programming language in computer science is, in many ways, similar to learning a natural human language, because both deal with syntax, structure, and vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that also rubbed me the wrong way was the gender framing. As someone with two X chromosomes, I find the conclusion uncomfortable. I dislike the implication that “girls are/should be good at X because they’re girls” or “boys are/should be better at Y because they’re boys”—even when it’s backed by research. It feels reductive and reinforces the same boxes we’ve been trying to break out of.\n",
