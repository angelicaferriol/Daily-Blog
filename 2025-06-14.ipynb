    "## What is \"Decrease and Conquer\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: **“Solve the problem for a smaller input, then use that solution to build the answer for the full input.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually done by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reducing the size by one** (most common, and what we're focusing on)\n",
    "* Solving the smaller subproblem\n",
    "* Extending the solution\n",

    "## Insertion Sort – \"Taga-ayos ng kalat, isa-isa\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "Parang nag-aayos ka ng test papers, one at a time, inserting each into its proper position relative to already sorted ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the 2nd element.\n",
    "2. Compare it to elements before it.\n",
    "3. Insert it in the correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Sorting `[5, 2, 4, 6, 1]`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with `[5]` (sorted)\n",
    "* Insert `2` → `[2, 5]`\n",
    "* Insert `4` → `[2, 4, 5]`\n",
    "* Insert `6` → `[2, 4, 5, 6]`\n",
    "* Insert `1` → `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decrease and conquer part?** You sort the first `n-1` elements and then insert the last one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time complexity:**\n",
    "Worst-case: `O(n²)` (kapag baliktad lahat)\n",
    "Best-case: `O(n)` (kung halos sorted na)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shaker Sort – “Pabebe Insertion Sort”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Also known as:** Bidirectional Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "Parang gumuguhit ka ng sahig: paikot-ikot, back-and-forth, nililinis yung smallest and largest sa bawat pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Forward pass – move the largest element to the end.\n",
    "2. Backward pass – move the smallest to the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Decrease and Conquer?**\n",
    "Each full cycle (forward + backward) **shrinks** the unsorted portion from both ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time complexity:**\n",
    "Still `O(n²)` in worst case, but can be faster than regular Bubble Sort if may konting order na.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Depth First Search (DFS) – “Hanap ng lalim, hindi lapad”\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "Traverse as deep as possible along one branch before backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Used in:** Graphs and Trees (e.g., solving a maze, dependency resolution, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit a node.\n",
    "2. Recurse (or push) to the next unvisited adjacent node.\n",
    "3. Backtrack if no unvisited neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decrease and conquer part?**\n",
    "You reduce the problem by visiting one node, **removing** it from the unvisited set, then recurse on the smaller graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can be implemented by:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recursion\n",
    "* Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time complexity:** `O(V + E)` where `V = vertices`, `E = edges`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breadth First Search (BFS) – “Hanap ng lapad, hindi lalim”\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "Traverse the graph level by level—**good for finding shortest path** in unweighted graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit the starting node.\n",
    "2. Visit all of its neighbors.\n",
    "3. Then visit their neighbors, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uses a Queue** (FIFO – First In First Out)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decrease and conquer part?**\n",
    "You process one level at a time, reducing the graph problem by removing processed nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time complexity:** `O(V + E)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topological Sort – “Prerequisite Checking sa Enlistment”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Only works for:** Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "Find an order of tasks such that every task comes **after** its prerequisites.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example use case:** Course scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two main approaches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DFS-based:** Postorder traversal, reverse the result.\n",
    "2. **Kahn's algorithm (BFS-based):** Start with in-degree 0 nodes, then remove them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decrease and conquer part?**\n",
    "Each time you remove a node with no incoming edge (no prereqs), you're shrinking the graph and solving a smaller problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine yung **DFS at BFS** ay dalawang magkaibang estudyante na naligaw sa building ng PUP:\n",

    "* Si **DFS**, pumasok sa hallway, tas tuluy-tuloy sa pinaka-madilim na sulok ng hallway kahit walang ilaw, bago bumalik.\n",
    "* Si **BFS**, dumaan muna sa lahat ng bukas na pinto sa unang floor, bago umakyat.\n",

    "Meanwhile, si **Topological Sort**, yun yung kaibigan mong gusto munang tapusin lahat ng **prereq** subjects before kumuha ng thesis. Kasi hello, paano ka magt-thesis kung wala ka pang DSA?\n"
