# About This Project
This is my public daily blog where I document what I learn, think, and build each day. **Writing = thinking**â€”through writing I can process, solidify, and track my growth. 

## Why I Started This Blog?
- Track my progress in CS, marine science, and personal projects
- Practice clarity of thought through writing
- Stay accountable and build a consistent learning habit

I update this every day as part of my digital learning footprint.

## How to Use This?

1. **Read the Latest Posts:** Check in daily for my newest reflections.
2. **Start Your Own:** If this inspires you, start your own daily blog to reflect on your learning.
