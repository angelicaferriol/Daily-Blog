# About This Project
This is my daily blog where I reflect on something I learned each day. **Writing = thinking**—I believe by writing about what I learn, I can process, solidify, and track my growth. It’s not about perfection, just consistent daily learning.

## Why I Started This Blog?

- **Today I Learned:** Each post captures one key takeaway from the day, helping me stay present and intentional about my learning.
- **Physical Journals Aren’t Enough:** I needed a consistent, public outlet to hold myself accountable.
- **Public Accountability:** Sharing my reflections on GitHub helps me stay committed to daily writing and growth.

## How to Use This?

1. **Read the Latest Posts:** Check in daily for my newest reflections.
2. **Start Your Own:** If this inspires you, start your own daily blog to reflect on your learning.
