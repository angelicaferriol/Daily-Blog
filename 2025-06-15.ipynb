    "# Daily Blog #46 - Greedy Algorithm\n",
    "### June 15, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Greedy Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Always pick what looks best *right now*.**\n",
    "> No second thoughts. No backtracking. Bahala na si future self — *basta mukhang okay ngayon*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Local optimal choice at each step\n",
    "* No reconsideration once a decision is made\n",
    "* Fast and simple (usually `O(E log V)` or better)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prim’s Algorithm – “Tanim ng Network, Paunti-unti”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Connect all nodes (e.g., cities, computers) with **minimum total edge weight**, without cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start from any node.\n",
    "* Add the **cheapest edge** connecting a visited node to an unvisited node.\n",
    "* Repeat until all nodes are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why greedy?\n",
    "\n",
    "It always picks the *cheapest edge* available at each step. Doesn’t look ahead — kung anong best sa moment, yun kunin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* With min-heap + adjacency list: `O(E log V)`\n",
    "* Naive (adj matrix + linear search): `O(V²)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine may campus LAN setup. Gusto mong ikabit lahat ng computers sa cheapest wires possible. **Prim’s** is like starting from your own PC and plugging into the closest one, then branching out from there — one by one, cheap-cheap lang.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kruskal’s Algorithm – “Chismis Collector ng Cheapest Links”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Also solves: **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sort **all edges** by weight.\n",
    "2. Add the **smallest edge** that doesn’t form a cycle.\n",
    "3. Repeat until you’ve connected all nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Tool: **Disjoint Set / Union-Find** to check if adding edge creates a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why greedy?\n",
    "\n",
    "It picks **globally cheapest edges first**, regardless of where it connects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `O(E log E)` due to edge sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like **collecting the cheapest chismis (edges)** but making sure you don’t repeat the same story (cycle). As long as your chika isn’t redundant, you're free to spread it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dijkstra’s Algorithm – “Waze pero walang traffic drama”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: **Single-source shortest path** in a graph with **non-negative** edge weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the source node.\n",
    "2. At each step, pick the **closest unvisited node**.\n",
    "3. Update distances to its neighbors.\n",
    "4. Repeat until all shortest paths are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why greedy?\n",
    "\n",
    "It picks the **closest node** at every step and assumes that’s the best decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Min-heap (priority queue)\n",
    "* Distance array\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* With heap: `O((V + E) log V)`\n",
    "* Naive: `O(V²)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re in the PUP main building trying to find the fastest way to reach your next class — *Dijkstra’s* is your brain ignoring the 4th floor elevator (because delay na naman) and taking the shortest stairs to Room 301 kahit mas mahaba distance-wise, kasi faster irl.\n",
