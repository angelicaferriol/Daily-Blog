    "#### **What is a Spatial Join?**\n",
    "- A **spatial join** combines **two spatial datasets** based on their geographic relationship.\n",
    "- Like an **attribute join** (matching IDs) but instead of joining based on a column (like “site name”), you join based on **where things are** on the map!\n",

    "#### **Real-World Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Find which marine protected area (MPA) each reef point is inside** → link reef survey data with MPA data.\n",
    "* **Assign a “flood risk zone” to barangays** based on the polygon of the flood risk layer.\n",
    "* **Attach administrative region data to GPS points** of marine species sightings.\n",

    "* One layer: e.g., coral reef point data\n",
    "* Second layer: e.g., MPA polygons\n",
    "* Output: reef points with new columns from the MPA layer\n",
    "* Relationship: e.g., “within” or “intersects”\n",
