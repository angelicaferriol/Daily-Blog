    "# Daily Blog #37 -  Core GIS Concepts\n",
    "### June 6, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is GIS?**\n",
    "GIS = **Geographic Information System**.\n",
    "A **GIS** is a system for:\n",
    "1. **Capturing** (collecting)\n",
    "2. **Storing** (managing)\n",
    "3. **Analyzing** (crunching)\n",
    "4. **Visualizing** (displaying)\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain terms:\n",
    "> It’s a **digital map-making and analysis tool** that helps you **see patterns, relationships, and insights** in data that has a **location** attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What does GIS actually do?**\n",
    "GIS can:\n",
    "* Make a **map** to show your data visually.\n",
    "* Analyze relationships:\n",
    " - Are schools near flood zones?\n",
    " - How much area is covered by forest?\n",
    "* Answer questions like:\n",
    " - What’s the nearest hospital to you?\n",
    " - Which areas have high risk of flooding?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Data\n",
    "* **Spatial data** = data with a **location** attached.\n",
    "* Two main types:\n",
    "  * **Vector data** (points, lines, polygons).\n",
    "  * **Raster data** (grid of pixels, like satellite images).\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "  * Point: wells, schools.\n",
    "  * Line: roads, rivers.\n",
    "  * Polygon: city boundaries, lakes.\n",
    "  * Raster: land cover map, rainfall data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attribute Data\n",
    "* Every spatial feature (like a point or polygon) has an **attribute table**—like a mini spreadsheet.\n",
    "* Columns = **fields** (e.g. name, area, population).\n",
    "* Rows = **features** (e.g. Barangay 1, Barangay 2).\n",
    "* GIS magic: link **where** something is (geometry) with **what** it is (attributes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coordinate Systems & Projections\n",
    "* **Earth is round** → but your map is flat.\n",
    "* Coordinate Reference System (CRS) = defines **how to flatten** the Earth for your map.\n",
    "* Common ones:\n",
    "  * **WGS84** (EPSG:4326) → global lat/long (used in GPS).\n",
    "  * **UTM** (zone-specific, meters).\n",
    "* **Key**: Data must be in the **same CRS** when you overlay/join them, or your layers won’t line up.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Georeferencing\n",
    "* When you have a **scanned map** (raster) without coordinates, you **georeference** it by linking points on the image to real-world coordinates.\n",
    "* **Control points** = match map spots to real coordinates → software warps image to fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Digitizing\n",
    "* Creating new **vector features** (points, lines, polygons) **by tracing** on top of a raster or existing map.\n",
    "* Example: digitizing a road network from a satellite image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Joins\n",
    "* **Attribute Join**:\n",
    "  * You have a shapefile (e.g. barangays) + separate table (e.g. barangay population data).\n",
    "  * Join them by **common ID** (like “Barangay Name”).\n",
    "* **Spatial Join** (advanced):\n",
    "  * Combines features based on **location** (e.g. assign each school to its barangay).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Styling & Visualization\n",
    "* Symbology: colors, line thickness, fill color, etc.\n",
    "* Labels: add text (like barangay names).\n",
    "* Create **legends, scale bars, north arrows** for your final map.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Analysis\n",
    "* **Calculating area/perimeter** of polygons.\n",
    "* **Buffering** (e.g. create a 500m radius around schools).\n",
    "* **Clip** (cut out data to focus on your area of interest).\n",
    "* **Intersect** (find where two layers overlap, e.g. flood zone + barangays).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It All Ties Together**\n",
    "- You load spatial data (vector/raster) →\n",
    "- Style it for **clarity** →\n",
    "- Join attribute data for **insights** →\n",
    "- Georeference/ digitize new data if needed →\n",
    "- Export a **polished map** for sharing or analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Open Source Tools You’ll Use**\n",
    "* **QGIS** → your main tool for everything above.\n",
    "* **GDAL** → library for processing rasters and vectors (under the hood of QGIS).\n",
    "* **Python + geopandas** → advanced scripting (but for now, you’ll stick to QGIS)."
