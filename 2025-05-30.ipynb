    "# Daily Blog #30 - Pareto Principle (80/20)\n",
    "### May 30, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is it\n",
    "The Pareto Principle says that **80% of outcomes come from 20% of causes**. In other words, a small number of inputs have a disproportionately large impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example**:\n",
    "  * 80% of sales come from 20% of customers.\n",
    "  * 80% of your stress comes from 20% of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn’t a hard law but an observation about imbalances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Insight\n",
    "The Pareto Principle forces you to **identify the “vital few” and ignore the “trivial many.”** It’s about leverage: put your time and energy where it matters most.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actionable Steps\n",
    "**Identify your 20%**:\n",
    "* What’s the 20% of tasks causing 80% of your stress?\n",
    "* What’s the 20% of skills that could skyrocket your confidence?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eliminate or delegate the trivial 80%**:\n",
    "* Stop fussing over low-impact tasks that don’t move the needle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Double down on the 20%**:\n",
    "* Systematically invest time and energy into the things that yield the greatest payoff."
