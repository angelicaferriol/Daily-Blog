    "# Daily Blog #5 – Not Nervous ≠ Unprepared\n",
    "### May 5, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why This Entry Matters  \n",
    "Today, I focused on reviewing more on hands-on, by rewriting most concepts. This entry kind of shows how confident I am for the upcoming exams for the next three days which I could tell you that I am nervous  because I am not nervous for the upcoming exams. I acknowledge its importance, but the exam doesn't solely reflect what I learn for the last couple of months, but also the effect of the system and the varying factors. In fact, I'm really just reminded of my past exams and I'm glad that I've learned my lesson and realized what I truly want from myself and from this institution. This is why I don't need to pressure myself too much and just do what I can. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### What I Worked On  \n",
    "- Finished reviewing Information Management Concepts + Exercises on Normalization and ERD to Relation (Confidence: 95%)\n",
    "- Half-finished analyzing/revewing previous tests on Data Communications and Networking (but I still have 4 hours gap before the exam so I can review a bit more - Confidence: 90%)\n",

    "##### Next Steps  \n",
    "- Take the IM and DCN exam with 100% confidence because you are capable of acing them \n",
    "- Review for OS and really focus on Design and Analysis and Algorithms in studying tomorrow\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reflection  \n",
    "I should refrain myself from entertaining unnecessary spiels (in personal sense) as it affects my mindset for the day. I realized I couldn't do much of my habits-in-practice (i.e., pilates and blog reading) when I am in deep work.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Meta  \n",
    "- Time spent: ~7 hours (5h IM review and practice exercises, 2h DCN practice tests)\n",
    "- Tools: Vaia, itexamandanswers.com, YouTube, VScode"
