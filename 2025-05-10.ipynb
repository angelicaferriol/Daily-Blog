    "I haven't bounce back, not because I can't but I genuinely don't want to yet. I feel like I'm succumbing to this so-called rest--giving my body and brain a break. I read some blogs, read few pages of the book, and search some cool stuffs but I didn't note them down. In fact, I was just consuming information passively. This is a bad rebellion to this blog, which I swear this will be committed to what I learn every day, but the content today isn't, I know. But please, tolerate my unreasonable nags during this period. I promise to start again when I regain the life in me."
