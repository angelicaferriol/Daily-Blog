    "I haven’t bounced back—not because I can’t, but because I genuinely don’t want to yet. I feel like I’m surrendering to this so-called rest, letting my body and brain slow down. I read a few blogs, skimmed some pages of a book, and looked up random cool stuff, but I didn’t take any notes. I just consumed passively. Honestly, this feels like a quiet rebellion against what this blog is supposed to be—something committed to intentional learning every day. Today doesn’t reflect that. I know it. But I’m asking you (and myself) to tolerate this phase. To let me sit in the mess without needing to perform. I promise I’ll start again—properly—when I feel life return to me."
