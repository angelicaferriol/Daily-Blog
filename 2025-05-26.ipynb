    "# Daily Blog #26 – Cognitive Load Theory \n",

    "### What is Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive Load Theory is about how your brain’s **working memory** has **limited capacity**. Think of it like your RAM — if you overload it, performance tanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 types of cognitive load:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intrinsic Load** – The inherent difficulty of the material.\n",
    "2. **Extraneous Load** – Unnecessary complexity in how it’s presented.\n",
    "3. **Germane Load** – The effort used to create meaning and build long-term knowledge (schemas).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job as a learner? **Minimize extraneous load**, **optimize germane load**, and **pace intrinsic load** based on your current level.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters for you?\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re likely overloading yourself with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Too many open tabs\n",
    "* Dense PDF readings\n",
    "* Watching 2x speed videos while taking notes\n",
    "* Switching topics mid-study\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re burning **RAM** without storing **anything** in long-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to apply it *strategically*?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Chunk information**\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t memorize an algorithm line-by-line. Group concepts into patterns or processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: Divide-and-conquer = “Split → Solve recursively → Merge.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Dual-coding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine **visuals + text**. Don’t just read code—draw flowcharts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Sketch quick diagrams of how recursion splits input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Eliminate noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kill all distractions and badly designed learning materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the prof’s slides suck, recreate them *your way*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Use worked examples, then fade**\n",
    "\n",
    "Study solved problems first. Then slowly try problems with less scaffolding.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Don’t brute-force problems right away. Understand first, apply second.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Space your learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cramming overloads working memory. Spaced repetition is how you build durable schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re feeling stuck or overwhelmed when learning algorithms or any complex topic, it’s *not just* a motivation issue. You’re probably violating Cognitive Load Theory and flooding your brain with unstructured inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix your cognitive architecture first — that’s how high-performers *scale*.\n"
