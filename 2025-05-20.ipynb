    "# Daily Blog #20 – What’s Wrong with Me?\n",
    "\n",
    "### May 20, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog’s a bit of a departure from the usual template—because frankly, if I followed it, I’d just be repeating the same tasks I did yesterday. And sadly, those tasks didn’t lead to any fresh insights or learning. So today, I’m changing it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth? The reason I’m not doing “better” tasks—like actual coding challenges or applying for internships—is because I’m stuck with academic work *and* procrastinating on it. I dread it. There’s something off with me… or at least with my systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I asked ChatGPT (because it knows me on a level most people don’t), and here’s what it gave me:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alright Angelica, let’s cut the fluff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a brutally honest breakdown of what’s *actually* been going wrong—assuming you're still stuck in the same loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **You’re stuck in “strategic planning” mode, not execution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have great ideas, big goals, polished systems. But you’re not translating them into **consistent daily action**. That gap is killing your momentum and confidence. You’re thinking like a visionary, but acting like a procrastinator. Vision without execution is fantasy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fix:** Drop the 50-tab Notion setups. Hyper-focus on 1–3 non-negotiable actions per day. Track them ruthlessly. No excuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **You’re addicted to the reset button.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You build momentum, crash from burnout, then try to “start fresh.” It’s a loop. You romanticize change more than you tolerate discomfort.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fix:** Stop restarting. Start *continuing*. Progress isn’t sexy—discipline is. Show up even when you’re unmotivated, not just when you’re inspired.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **You’re self-neglecting under the excuse of “being busy.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic tasks—hygiene, sleep, movement—are still being skipped. That’s not busyness. That’s self-sabotage.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fix:** Treat your body like it belongs to the future you. No progress sticks if the vessel carrying it is breaking down.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **You’re intellectually overstimulated but emotionally underfed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You chase challenge, ambition, stimulation. But emotionally, you’re starved. You don’t feel fulfilled because you're always chasing the next thing. That leads to burnout and identity confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fix:** Build emotional wins into your week. Journal. Celebrate small progress. Do something joyful and purposeless once a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **You want polymathy—but you’re spread too thin.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Art, violin, languages, CS, business, marine AI, productivity, law nostalgia... You’re not *too ambitious*. You’re just bandwidth-split.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fix:** Use a **seasonal focus system**. Pick 1 core mission per 3–4 months. Keep the rest in \"maintenance mode\" (e.g., 15 min/week max).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **You’re being held hostage by perfectionism.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re still scared to fail publicly, make ugly drafts, or get a bad grade. So you avoid, delay, or over-polish. That’s a slow death in high-output fields like CS, design, and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fix:** Force bad outputs. Make ugly things, fast. Speed breeds clarity. Clarity leads to mastery. Mastery builds confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **You’ve mistaken introspection for growth.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You reflect a lot—but insight without action isn’t growth. Self-awareness is running laps around your self-discipline.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fix:** For every realization you write down, assign a concrete action with a deadline. No implementation = no transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### TL;DR:\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re brilliant—but brilliance without systems, health, and ruthless execution **rots**.\n",
    "You need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Harden your routines.\n",
    "* Commit to discomfort.\n",
    "* Stay grounded in the boring stuff.\n",
    "* Act first. Reflect after.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do I say?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ha... Fixing..."
